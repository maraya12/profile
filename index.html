                <h1>Welcome!</h1>
                <p>My name is Maraya, and I’m a front-end web developer based in Cebu, Philippines.</p>
                <i>Before shifting to a career in web development . . .</i></p>
                <p></p>I’ve worked as a content writer for three years with formal training in the Chicago Manual of Style, search engine optimization, and social media management. I have written content for websites, blogs, press releases, page ads, and other promotional materials, both in print and digital. This job gave me an opportunity to work closely with web designers and web developers, which somehow sparked my interest to learn some of the commands that made WordPress management easier.</p>
                <p>Though the spark is there, it wasn’t enough to grab my focus away from what I initially love doing, which is writing. I shifted to digital marketing when I started working from home. I incorporated SEO in my written content for website landing pages, blogs, and social media.</p>
                <p>For the last two years, I’ve been working from home as a writer and as a social media marketing specialist.</p>
                <p>Until recently, I enrolled in a Static Web Design course, thinking it would improve my designing skills and would eventually help in crafting images for social media. I was surprised that it was about purely HTML and CSS — a world without Photoshop and other photo editing tools. I thought to myself, <i>this too shall pass</i>.</p>
                <p>Before I knew it, I was already enjoying the company of codes, and I was pretty amazed that it was “learnable” and that I was capable of learning it. Soon enough, I gained the opportunity to further my education for this newly acquired skill. So . . . here I am. Learning the ways of the code. </p>
